1. The IPYNB file can be opened and edited in Visual Studio Code (if supported). By 31 January 2021, everything looks good with the code editor (Version: 1.52.1). As an option, you can also use Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda to edit these IPYNB files. The main packages used in the development are listed in the following table.
